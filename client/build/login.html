                    <p>The standard rules of play for all variations of the game are as follows</p><br>
                    <p>- Order of play is either clockwise or counter-clockwise</p><br>
                    <p>- The first piece played of each color is placed in one of the board's four corners. Each new piece played must be placed so that it touches at least one piece of the same color, with only corner-to-corner contact allowedâ€”edges cannot touch. However, edge-to-edge contact is allowed when two pieces of different color are involved.</p><br>
                    <p>- When a player cannot place a piece, he or she passes, and play continues as normal. The game ends when no one can place a piece</p><br>
                    <p>When a game ends, the score is based on the number of squares in each player's pieces on the board (e.g. a tetromino is worth 4 points). If a player played all of his or her pieces, he or she gets a bonus score of +20 points if the last piece played was a monomino, +15 points otherwise.</p><br>
